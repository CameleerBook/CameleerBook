            <p class="body-intro-title">What?</p>
            <p class="body-intro-text">"Apprendre la vérification avec Cameleer" is a textbook for learning
              formal verification of software through the use of automated deductive
              tools, such as Cameleer, Why3 and SMT solvers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="body-intro-item">
            <p class="body-intro-title">Why?</p>
            <p class="body-intro-text">In various contexts software failure can lead to serious
              consequences, for instance endangering human lives.
              Verifying correctness through unit testing is insufficient, as it
              cannot guarantee the absence of bugs.
              Instead, we must rely on formal methods and their teaching.

          <div class="body-intro-item">
            <p class="body-intro-title">How?</p>
            <p class="body-intro-text">"Apprendre la vérification avec Cameleer" uses classical algorithms
              and data structures to teach about verification.
              By using well-known problems, we believe most readers will be
              vaguely familiarized or, at the very least, can be easily search
              on other sources of information.

          <!--<p>Welcome to the webpage of "Apprendre la vérification avec Cameleer",
            a textbook for learning software verification through classical algorithms
            and data structures. <br><br>

            There is a Chinese proverb that roughly translates to "To know a fish go
            to the water. To know a bird's song go to the mountains", and we would
            like to add: To know programming go to the verification field. <br><br>

            Why do we say that? While compilers or other fields of Computer Science
            are very import to understand how programming languages and computers
            work under the hood, both tools are means to an end when solving a
            problem. Each tool may have its own particularities and lead to different
            solutions in a practical sense, but the theoretical reasoning behind is
            similar. <br><br>

            Formal Verification as a field is concerned with the soundness of said
            reasoning. This can be achieved through the use of mathematical and
            logical statements and proofs. With automated verification tools, such
            as Cameleer, Why3 and SMT provers, the work of the Verification engineer
            is facilitated, but nonetheless a hard endeavour. With this book we
            hope to create an adequate learning experience with valuable material
            for the next generation of Verification engineers.</p>-->
