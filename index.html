              is a textbook for learning Formal Verification of software through
              the use of automated deductive tools, such as Cameleer, Why3 and
              SMT solvers. Formal Verification is a field of Computer Science
              concerned with the proving the soundness of the reasoning and
              implementation of a piece of software, through the use of logical
              statements and mathematical properties.</p>

            <p class="body-intro-text">In various contexts software failure can
              lead to undesired and serious consequences, for instance endangering
              human lives. Verifying of software correctness through unit testing
              is unreliable and insufficient, as any industrial-grade software has
              an unimaginable number of possible states. Instead, we must rely on
              Formal Verification, and although not an easy endeavour, this can
              be facilitated to an extent with automated deductive tools.

            <p class="body-intro-text">"Apprendre la vérification avec Cameleer"
              uses classical algorithms and data structures as a vehicle to teach
              about Formal Verification. By using well-known algorithms, we believe
              most readers will be vaguely familiarized with the problem or, at
              the very least, can be easily searched on other sources of information.
              In this book we use Cameleer, Why3 and a few SMT solvers as our
              primary tools, as we want to provide the next generation of
              Verification Engineer with both practical and theoretical knowledge.

          <!--<p>Welcome to the webpage of "Apprendre la vérification avec Cameleer",
            a textbook for learning software verification through classical algorithms
            and data structures. <br><br>

            There is a Chinese proverb that roughly translates to "To know a fish go
            to the water. To know a bird's song go to the mountains", and we would
            like to add: To know programming go to the verification field. <br><br>

            Why do we say that? While compilers or other fields of Computer Science
            are very import to understand how programming languages and computers
            work under the hood, both tools are means to an end when solving a
            problem. Each tool may have its own particularities and lead to different
            solutions in a practical sense, but the theoretical reasoning behind is
            similar. <br><br>

            Formal Verification as a field is concerned with the soundness of said
            reasoning. This can be achieved through the use of mathematical and
            logical statements and proofs. With automated verification tools, such
            as Cameleer, Why3 and SMT provers, the work of the Verification engineer
            is facilitated, but nonetheless a hard endeavour. With this book we
            hope to create an adequate learning experience with valuable material
            for the next generation of Verification engineers.</p>-->
